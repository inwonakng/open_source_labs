Reading the chapter about Jesse, I learned about the possible blowbacks to writing software that's open for everybody's use. It was an interesting story because I also go to RPI, and to find out that someone who is in a similar place to mine was able to achieve so much is very impressive. Now I feel like I am a bit more knowledgable in what to expect as a person working on open source projects. I really hope what happened to Jesse doesn't happen to me. Regardless of what happened, I think it is very cool that students keep coming up with new services targeted for other students to use and benefit the entire community.
