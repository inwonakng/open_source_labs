2. Choosing a license is important because that's the best way to ensure that your software is used in the manners you intended. There are many different licenses that seem similar, but each one has a unique quality and a different interpretation of the four freedoms of software, and it is important that the project leader/starter chooses the most fitting license for their project.

3. Making sure that a project has an explicit license is important because if the license is not specified, it is illegal to use/modify the project. Without an explicit license, the project does not guarantee any of the four freedoms of software.

4. I don't personally know what happened back then, but after reading the article I agree with the author's analysis. It is kind of sad that the developers of gopher worked hard but the project was heading the wrong way. It is interesting to see that open source was such a big movement even back in the early days.

5. The fact that Android uses the Apache license 2.0 can be justified because Android is an OS that is meant to run on a very wide spectrum of devices manufactured by different companies. The Apache license 2.0 allows for modification and redistribution of the software, which allows for the hardware companies to make necessary tweaks to the OS before they let it out in the market.
